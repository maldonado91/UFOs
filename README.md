# UFO's

### 1. Overview of Project:
#### We are building a web page that will use filters to slice and dice UFO data to the end users liking. A table will then be displayed based on search criteria for in-depth analysis on UFO sightings. 

### 2. Results:

* Any user will be able to utilize the fields below to shrink the data table to a more condensed version.

* Here is an example if we use the filters: 

    * Date: 1/1/2010
    * City: bonita
    * State: ca
    * Country: us
    * Shape: light

* We get back one result

### 3. Summary:
#### The easiest draawback to point out is that the filters will accept any type of input. This might be an issue if there are mispellings or there is a data type problem. An exmaple can be using a non date input in the Date filter or spelling ca in full in the State filter.

#### I recommend a data validation method for each filter (or drop down) and a message that notifies users of no search results.
